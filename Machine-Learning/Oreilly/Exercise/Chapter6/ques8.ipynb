    "- continuing the previous exercise, generate 1000 data sets of training set, each containing hundred instances selected randomly. You can use `Scikit-learn's` `ShuffleSplit` class for this. \n",
    "- training one decision tree on each subset using a best hyperparameter value found in the previous exercise evaluating these 1000 decision trees on the test set. Since they are trained on smaller sets, these decision trees will likely perform worse than the first decision tree, achieving only about 80% accuracy.\n",
    "- See, now comes the magic. For each test set instance generate a prediction of 1000 decision trees and kept only the most frequent prediction. You can use `SciPy` `mode()` function for this. This approach gives you majority vote prediction over the test set. \n",
    "- Evaluate these predictions on the test set. You should obtain a slightly higher accuracy than your first model. About 0.5 to 15% higher. Congratulations, you have trained a random forest classifier."
